## Introduction

As a result of my curiosity sparked by receiving an OTP verification email during registration on an Edtech website, I decided to delve into the mechanics behind OTP functionality. This project is a culmination of that exploration, where I developed an OTP Registration App using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

## Features

- **OTP Verification**: Users receive OTPs via email for enhanced security during registration.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt for data protection.
- **Email Delivery**: Nodemailer is utilized to seamlessly send OTPs to users' email addresses.
- **API Fetching**: Axios handles efficient data retrieval from APIs.
- **Frontend Experience**: Input boxes intelligently move to the next index, enhancing user experience.
